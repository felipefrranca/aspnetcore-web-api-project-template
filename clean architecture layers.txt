Domain lyer não pode ter referência de qualquer outro projeto, 
mas Application layer precisa fazer referência a Domain layer

# Domain Layer

Entities, 
Core Business Rules, 
Factory Interfaces, 
Enumerations,
value objects,
custom exceptions

# Application Layer

Implement use cases for you application

suggest: use Mediator for use cases
suggest: use Fluent Validation for dependency injection

# Infrastructure Layer

Introduce any external concerns such as external services or maybe the database
some people like to split the infrastrucure layer into the infrastructure and
persistence layers where persistence layer takes care of everything that
is database related you can do this if you want to but it comes down to a
personal preference

# Presentation Layer

here again you have two options, 

one approach is to have a separate project
for the presentatio layer here you're going to place your controllers or 
minimal API endpoints or razor pages 
depending what you're using for the presentation

the other approach is to justify a web API project and define all of these inside
of that project as well
